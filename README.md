# MockRepository

A mock source code repository.

Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/dtZPXou68wU

To The User:
- Please be sure to set multiple startup projects, CommServer, CommUser, and GUI and run with VisualStudio.

This was the forth out of four projects for my Object Oriented Design course.  The projects built upon one another, 
culminating in the fourth and final project included here (though I completely started from scratch beginning with 
project two, and for the most part did not include source code from project one with the other projects). 

Please check out the MockRepository_README file included with the other files above, it is not a copy of this README, 
includes details about project requirements and how these were met, plus known issues and improper usage which can 
cause the program to crash.
