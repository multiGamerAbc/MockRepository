Dear Reader,
I have a new appreciation for maintenance records, but this one is not comprehensive.
Indeed, there were many things done on many other days which are not recorded here.  
And, further, I should applogize for not removing unnecessary entries.

Notes to Professer:
Be sure to set multiple sartup projects, CommServer and CommUser.

############ 6 / 17 / 18  #########################################################################

- building CTP file Xfer Request Function

scratch64_b

deleted StaticLogger stuff from main
rearanged some more

scratch64_c

rearanged more.
renamed a bunch of functions (wont build)

scratch64_d

rearanged more.
used three startup projects, user, server, and CTP
passed messages among all three processes, user, server, CTP
added myCommDemo

scratch64_e

added sendNumMessagesToServer function to CommUser.cpp
added extractor function to CommServer
notes:
there seems to be an issue with the extractor function.
Or maybe it's the COMM.  There is inconsistent behavior.
I think I will try creating a unique Comm for each EndPoint pair.
Although, this doesn't seem right, since sometimes I get messages in
the server from both user and CTP, and other times I don't.
I'm wondering if there is a mutual exclusion necessity with these Comms.

scratch64_f

added new portNums, EPs, Comms, and extractor functions

scratch64_g

added communicationTest to User, Server, and CTP
added ioMutex to each.
sent 5 messages from each to each through dedicated Comms
added contrivedExtractorDelays to each
cleaned up / rearanged

############ 6 / 18 / 18  #########################################################################

scratch64_g

spawned process
modified (single CTP) port for comm with user

scratch64_h

tried to dynamically create Comms and EndPoints in CTP and broke.
Will try with pointers

scratch_i
broke

scratch_j
moved basically everything into main in order to have access to Comms and
EndPoints.  Couldn't seem to do it any other way.  Not what I had wanted to do.

scratch64_k
dynamically assigned port numbers in childTesterProcess using IDs passed to
spawn() in server

scratch64_l
added a bunch of port numbers, EndPoints, and Comms to the server

scratch64_m
added same to user

scratch64_n
modified some message commands, modified some extractors to check these

scratch64_o
Same again.  Commented-out msg.show()

scratch64_p
put port number in all Message names.  Changed other printed info.

scratch64_q
sent TestRequests to Server, then to CTPs, switching on ready message name (port)

############ 6 / 19 / 18  #######################################################################

scratch64_r
created sendNumMessagesToCtp_1B function.  sent msg to Ctp1.  extracted msg
from testReauestBQ and attached it's command() to a new message msg2, and sent
that to Ctp1 as well.

scratch64_s
abandoned

scratch64_t
Created matchTestRequestsToReadyCTPs() function.  This dispatches TRs to CTPs.

scratch64_u
Added doTest() function to CTP, 3 CTPs run tests.

scratch64_v
Modified CTP logic.

scratch_w
(A) CTP sends file requetsts and User returns file messages.

-- abandon scratch64_x --

p3b
Added shared_mutex fileMutex to CommUser, only in ctp_1 specific code.

p3c
Succesfully synchronized sendfile directory access

p3d
cleanup

p3f
More cleanup

p3g
Modified the Message class to add timeDate() function.
Added code to demonstrate all requirement #4 items (to do with Message)

p3h
Modifed printout in CommUser.

p3i
Cleanup, organized, added comments, sorted #includes, etc

p3j
Privatized requestVector in FileManager 
Removed all copies of unneeded file dllmain.cpp
